## Chapter 1 - Syntax Basics

### Exercise 1: Fill in the Blanks

The program below should take a number of cans of food and calculate their total weight. It should declare a `count` variable with the number of cans, and a `unitWeight` variable with the amount (in kilograms) that each can weighs. It should then multiply `count` by `unitWeight`, and assign the result to a new `totalWeight` variable. Finally, it should print the number of cans and their total weight.

Fill in the blanks in the program so that it will run and produce the specified output. Note that `count` will have a type of `int`, but `unitWeight` will have a type of `float64`, so you'll need to do a conversion before you can multiply the two together.

### Solution

{% highlight go %}
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var count int = 20
    unitWeight := 0.4
    totalWeight := float64(count) * unitWeight
    fmt.Println(count, "cans weigh", totalWeight, "kilograms")
}
{% endhighlight %}

Output:

``` text
20 cans weigh 8 kilograms
```
