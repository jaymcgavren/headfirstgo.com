## Chapter 3 - Inheritance

### Exercise 2: Cupcakes

We have a `Confection` class representing baked desserts below. Your job is to create a new subclass of `Confection`, named `Cupcake`. Cupcakes need to be baked just like other confections, but they also need to be frosted afterward.

Write a `prepare` method for your `Cupcake` class that prints `"Baking at 350 degrees for 25 minutes."`, and *then* prints `"Applying frosting."` Do this *without* duplicating the `puts` line from the `prepare` method of the `Confection` class.

### Solution

{% highlight ruby %}
class Confection
  def prepare
    puts "Baking at 350 degrees for 25 minutes."
  end
end

class Cupcake < Confection
  def prepare
    super
    puts "Applying frosting."
  end
end

# The below code should output the following
# 2 lines of text:
#
# Baking at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.
# Applying frosting.
cupcake = Cupcake.new
cupcake.prepare
{% endhighlight %}
